1. AWS Services used to implement Data Lake
    - S3 (Storage)
    - KMS (encrypt data at rest)
    - Cloudfront (used as a CDN to reduce webpage load times for any end-user facing data lake web applications)
    - Kinesis Firehouse
    - Active Directory (Authentication)
    - Glue (Cataloging)
    - Cassandra or ElasticSearch (NoSQL document store)
    - MySQL (HCatalog) or DynamoDB (store metadata)
    - Athena/Redshift (Analytics and Interactive Querying)
    - ElasticSearch (Text search, logging, document store)
    - CloudWatch (Monitoring)
    - IAM Roles (Access Management)
    - API Gateway (To expose Lambda microservices as external endpoints)
    - Lambda (To build serverless microservices that trigger various events
      through out the data lifecycle in the data lake. These lambda functions
       interact with backend services like ElasticSearch and DynamoDB to
       accomplish business objectives).

2. What is a Data Lake?
   - Not to be confused with a data swamp, a data lake is a datawarehouse in a world were the business needs are very different.
     Such needs include dealing with data involving evolving schemas; high volume data where loading data is more important than transforming data.
     The data governance aspect of data lakes prevent the lakes from becoming swamps.
   - This kind of data platform adheres with the schema-on-read principle.

3. Kafka
    - Brokers: unit of computational work in Kafka cluster
    - Topics
    - Threads
    - Replicas: for high availbility of topics
    - Zookeeper: cluster coordinator
    - Producers
    - Consumers
    - KafkaConnect: moving data in and out of Kafka cluster without using consumers or producers
    - Kafka Streams and K SQL
    - Performance: network threads, SSDs, etc
    - Offsets
    - Monitoring with JMX
    - Partitioning: partition keys can be set for routing data to various partitions or shards
    - Rebalancing
    - Cluster Operations: decomissioning brokers, leader election, rebalancing, adding topics, increasing replication factor
    - Integrations:
       - Spark
       - ElasticSearch
